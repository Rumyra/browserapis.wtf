```js
// Dedicated Worker example, taking a value change and doing
// a mathematical operation in the worker thread before returning it back
// to the main script.
var myWorker = new Worker("worker.js");
var item = document.querySelector('input');

// When the value of the input changes, post the value to the worker
item.onchange = function() {
    myWorker.postMessage(item.value);
    console.log('Message posted to worker');
};

myWorker.onmessage = function(event) {
    console.log('Message received from worker', event.data);
};

// worker.js
onmessage = function(event) {
  console.log('Message received from main script');
  var workerResult = event.data * 2;
  console.log('Posting message back to main script');
  postMessage(workerResult);
}

```
